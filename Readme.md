# Zabbix Automation Scripts

Some scripts for automating the instalation of zabbix agents on Windows and Linux. Here are some templates and scripts, found on [zabbix community](https://share.zabbix.com/) and github, or made by myself. Keep in mind that some of templates and scripts must need revision before using, they were created or adapted to my own reallity.

## templates
