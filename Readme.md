# Zabbix Automation Scripts 

[![Deploy files to Zabbix server](https://github.com/rodcordeiro/zabbix_automation_scripts/actions/workflows/DeployFiles.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/rodcordeiro/zabbix_automation_scripts/actions/workflows/DeployFiles.yml)

 Some scripts for automating the instalation of zabbix agents on Windows and Linux. Here are some templates and scripts, found on [zabbix community](https://share.zabbix.com/) and github, or made by myself. Keep in mind that some of templates and scripts must need revision before using, they were created or adapted to my own reallity.

## templates
- [Service Monitoring via systemctl on Linux](templates#service-monitoring-via-systemctl-on-linux)
- [Monitoring Hyper-V](templates#monitoring-hyper-v)
